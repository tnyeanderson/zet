# Owncloud Infinite Scale (OCIS) feature parity

For me to transition from Nextcloud to OCIS, the following features are needed:

- [x] File sharing
- [x] Auto-upload from Android
- [x] Calendar
  - Last release was 2020 but development seems to be happening
- [x] Tasks
- [x] Markdown notes
- [x] Contacts
- [x] Photo gallery
- [ ] Bookmarks
  - Not frequently updated, might need new solution
- [ ] Geoblocker
  - Does have brute-force protection
- [x] OnlyOffice/Collabora integration
  - Both are available
- [x] 2FA
