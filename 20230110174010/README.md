# No zsh for you

This is just to keep track of the reasons ZSH sucks in case I'm asked. Mostly
linking to `rwxrob` and his excellent rants:

- It [breaks math](https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/blob/main/docs/1538/README.md)
- It [breaks `test`](https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/blob/main/docs/320/README.md)
- It [tries to be smart about completion](https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/blob/main/docs/773/README.md)
- It is heavy (when you factor in all the stupid oh-my-zsh goodies)
- It creates misconceptions that bubble up badly later

There are many more reasons, and I will add more to this list as I find them.
But the lesson is, don't use ZSH. Like ever. Especially anywhere near
production.

    #zsh #bash #shells
