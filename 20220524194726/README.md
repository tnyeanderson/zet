# ATX style headers

Markdown style headers are sometimes referred to "ATX-style" headers in things like Pandoc.

Examples:
```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

Markdown supports up to six levels of header.

## What is atx?

`atx` ("the true structured text format") was the precursor to markdown (both created by Aaron Swartz).
The atx spec included `#`-based headings, which later were included in the markdown standard.
